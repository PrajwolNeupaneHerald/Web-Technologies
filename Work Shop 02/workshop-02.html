      <p>
        <strong>Valorant</strong> is a team-based
        <em>first-person tactical</em> hero shooter set in the near future.
        Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several
        countries and cultures around the world.[6] In the main game mode,
        players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each
        team having five players on it.

          The American chemist,<code>&#8364;</code> Viper deploys an array of
          poisonous chemical devices to control the battlefield and cripple the
          enemy's vision. If the toxins don't kill her prey, her mind games
          surely will.

        <dt><strong>Brimstone</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Joining from the USA, Brimstone's orbital arsenal ensures his squad
          always has the advantage. His ability to deliver utility precisely and
          from a distance makes him an unmatched boots-on-the-ground commander.
